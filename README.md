## Documentation

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)```

Even more fancy markdown: [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

The name of the theme is stored in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file. You can either choose from one of the supported themes or use a remote-theme. To enable a theme:
`theme: jekyll-theme-minimal` OR `remote_theme: "vsoch/docsy-jekyll"`
 The current theme is the remote theme `docsy-jekyll`.
