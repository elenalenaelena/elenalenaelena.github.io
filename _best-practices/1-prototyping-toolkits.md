# __1 Prototyping Toolkits
Prototyping [Elastic Displays](/glossary/elastic-display) is challenging because it involves complex electronics as well as mechanical engineering. Specific use contexts may require different [actuation](/glossary/) approaches. What are suitable tools to test complex Elastic Display applications in an early development state?

### Solutions
We describe [prototyping toolkits](/glossary/) on three technological layers that can lower the barrier to implementation of classic interfaces: 
1. a standard platform for hardware prototyping, dealing with some aspects of actuation
2. a cross-platform software layer for applications and
3. tools for [end-user programming](/glossary/)

- followed up by linked explanations on different possibilities to overcome the challenge, for example [Physical Programming](/glossary/), [4D Printing](/glossary/), [Rapid Prototyping](/glossary/), [electromechanical]/[pneumatic]/[hydraulic actuation](/glossary/), [smart materials](/glossary/)
- (optional) decision helper

### Showcase
Showcase of either existing own projects or research results, e.g. [3D Printing](/glossary/) for the Rapid Prototyping of [Structural Electronics](/glossary/) <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6766751" target="_blank">[DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2311810]</a>

## Workshop
step-by-step workshop on one of the solutions above, e.g. Try Rapid Prototyping with 3D printing technologies
