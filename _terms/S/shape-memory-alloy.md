title: Shape memory alloy
description: definition of shape memory alloy
---
Shape memory alloys are an actuator technique for shape-changing displays. The metals alloys undergo temperature driven phase transformation between to different crystal forms (austenite = higher temperature phase / martensite = lower temperature phase). A change in crystal structure results in dimensional changes that are typically between 1% and 8%. Besides a range of iron-based and copper-based alloys the two most prevalent shape-memory alloys are copper-aluminium-nickel (cheap) and nickel-titanium (NiTi) (more stable but superior thermo-mechanic performance).
