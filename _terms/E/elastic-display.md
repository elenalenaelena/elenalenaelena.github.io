title: Elastic Display
description: Elastic Display in ZELASTO Knowledge Base

Focusing on deformation properties Elastic displays are [shape-changing interfaces](/terms/shape-changing-interface) that are only temporally deformable. They allow users to give input by force-touch mainly, e.g. pinching, pushing, folding, and twisting the display, which then automatically returns into its inital flat state. 

Moreover, the large visualization and interaction space of elastic displays is appropriate for vast amounts of Zoomable 2D, Volumetric 2.5D and Spatial 3D data contained in modern information visualizations. The evaluation of existing elastic display applications revealed that the physical dimension of depth is exspecially suited to retrace time-based changes or explore different levels of detail contained in the data. To make the content accessible Kammer et al. propose techniques such as image sequences, pixel-based blending, vector fields and single- or multi-touch 3D [[https://doi.org/10.1515/icom-2018-0021]](https://doi.org/10.1515/icom-2018-0021). They state that elastic displays can support users to discover relationships, understand structures, search items, manipulate data, make decisions and collaborate. Additionally, Tangibles or Gravible could be used to safe current state by retaining the current shape of the surface.
