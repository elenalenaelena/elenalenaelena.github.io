title: Elastic Display

Under the aspect of deformation properties, elastic displays are [shape-changing interfaces](/terms/shape-changing-interface) that are only temporally deformable. They allow users to give input by force-touch, e.g. pinching, pushing, folding, and twisting the display, which then automatically returns into its inital flat state. 

Most applications use rear-procection to display graphical content on the malleable surface, as it prevents users from covering the projection with their handâ€™s shadow while interacting. Nearly all feature the use of non-slippery, elastic fabric like for example latex, lycra and spandex. Detecting and tracking complex deformations and multi-touch on the deformable display are a remaining challenge. Many recent prototypes take advantage of the Microsoft Kinect depth sensor to rapidly detect multi-touch input in three dimensions, offsetting the high cost and unreliability of other approaches like infrared camera-based tracking.

The large visualization and interaction space of elastic displays is appropriate for vast amounts of Zoomable 2D, Volumetric 2.5D and Spatial 3D data contained in modern information visualizations. Evaluation of existing elastic display applications revealed that interaction with the dimension of depth is especially suited to retrace time-based changes or explore different levels of detail in the data. To make the content accessible Kammer et al. propose techniques such as image sequences, pixel-based blending, vector fields and single- or multi-touch 3D [[https://doi.org/10.1515/icom-2018-0021]](https://doi.org/10.1515/icom-2018-0021). They state that elastic displays can support users to discover relationships, understand structures, search items, manipulate data, make decisions and collaborate. Additionally, Tangibles or Gravible could be used to safe current state by retaining the current shape of the surface.
