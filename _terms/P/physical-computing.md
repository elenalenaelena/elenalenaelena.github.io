title: Physical Computing
description: definition of physical computing
---
Physical computing is, in short, making interactive physical systems out of hardware and software that sense changes in the real-world environment and respond to them. Analog input from sensors is digitalized and processed to software applications or electromechanical systems (e.g. motors, LEDs) or used to control other hardware components via actuators. If relying on software running on an embedded microconroller inside the system is called embedded system. Physical computing is used in a wide range of domains and applications such as education, art, and both scientific and commercial applications.

### Examples

**I-CubeX** is a system of sensors, actuators and interfaces configured by a personal computer. It uses MIDI, Bluetooth or USB for communication, making it simply for music or visual artists to create and modify musical instruments or interactive installations.

An example for physical computing with an embedded system is the popular open-source **Arduino** platform, developed by italian researcher Massimo Banzi and his team since 2005. Making it possible to simplay control interactive objects or to interact with software applications the platform gained great popularity in interactive art installations.

The **Raspberry Pi** is a mini linux comupter on a SD card. Pins allow makers and hobbyists to connect electronic components, extend the capabilities with add-on boards and program physical devices in the real world, such as inputs like sensors and outputs like lights.
